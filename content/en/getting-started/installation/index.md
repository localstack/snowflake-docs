{{< preview-notice >}}

## Introduction

You can use the Snowflake Docker image to run the Snowflake emulator.
The Snowflake Docker image is available on the [LocalStack Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/localstack/snowflake).
To pull the Snowflake Docker image, execute the following command:

{{< command >}}
$ docker pull localstack/snowflake
{{< / command >}}

You can start the Snowflake Docker container using the following methods:

1. [`localstack` CLI](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/#localstack-cli)
2. [`docker` CLI](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

{{<alert type="info">}}
Before starting, ensure you have a valid `LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN` to access the Snowflake emulator. Refer to the [Auth Token guide](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/auth-token/) to obtain your Auth Token and specify it in the `LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable.
{{</alert>}}

### `localstack` CLI

To start the Snowflake Docker container using the `localstack` CLI, execute the following command:

{{< command >}}
$ export LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=<your_auth_token>
$ localstack start --stack snowflake
{{< / command >}}

### `docker` CLI

To start the Snowflake Docker container using the `docker` CLI, execute the following command:

{{< command >}}
$ docker run \
    --rm -it \
    -p 127.0.0.1:4566:4566 \
    -p 127.0.0.1:4510-4559:4510-4559 \
    -p 127.0.0.1:443:443 \
    -e LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=${LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN:?} \
    localstack/snowflake
{{< / command >}}

### Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the specified content:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  localstack:
    container_name: "localstack-snowflake"
    image: localstack/snowflake
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:4566:4566"
      - "127.0.0.1:4510-4559:4510-4559"
      - "127.0.0.1:443:443"
    environment:
      - LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=${LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN:?}
    volumes:
      - "./volume:/var/lib/localstack"
```

Start the Snowflake Docker container with the following command:

{{< command >}}
$ docker-compose up
{{< / command >}}

## Updating

To update the Snowflake Docker container, pull the latest image and restart the container. The `latest` tag is the nightly build of the Snowflake Docker image.

## Troubleshooting

### How to check if the Snowflake emulator is running?

You can check if the Snowflake emulator is running by executing the following command:

{{< command >}}
$ curl -d '{}' snowflake.localhost.localstack.cloud:4566/session
{"success": true}
{{< / command >}}

### How to enable detailed debug logs?

You can set the `SF_LOG=trace` environment variable in the Snowflake container to enable detailed trace logs that show all the request/response message.

When using `docker-compose` then simply add this variable to the `environment` section of the YAML configuration file.
If you're starting up via the `localstack start` CLI, then make sure to start up via the following configuration: 

{{< command >}}
$ DOCKER_FLAGS='-e SF_LOG=trace' DEBUG=1 localstack start --stack snowflake
{{< / command >}}

### The `snowflake.localhost.localstack.cloud` hostname doesn't resolve on my machine, what can I do?

On some systems, including some newer versions of MacOS, the domain name `snowflake.localhost.localstack.cloud` may not resolve properly.
If you are encountering network issues and your Snowflake client drivers are unable to connect to the emulator, you may need to manually add the following entry to your `/etc/hosts` file:

{{< command >}}
127.0.0.1	snowflake.localhost.localstack.cloud
{{< / command >}}

## Next steps

Now that the Snowflake emulator is installed, you can use it for developing and testing your Snowflake data pipelines. Refer to our [Quickstart]({{< ref "quickstart" >}}) guide to get started.
