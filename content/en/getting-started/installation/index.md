description: Basic installation guide to get started with LocalStack for Snowflake
---

## Introduction

There are two methods for installing the Snowflake emulator:

- [Snowflake Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/localstack/snowflake) (recommended)
- [LocalStack Extension mechanism](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/extensions/) (deprecated)

{{<alert type="info">}}
Before starting, ensure you have a valid `LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN` to access the Snowflake emulator. Refer to the [Auth Token guide](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/auth-token/) to obtain your Auth Token and specify it in the `LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable.
{{</alert>}}

## Snowflake Docker image

You can use the Snowflake Docker image to run the Snowflake emulator - this is the recommended way of installation.
The Snowflake Docker image is available on the [LocalStack Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/localstack/snowflake).
To pull the Snowflake Docker image, execute the following command:

{{< command >}}
$ docker pull localstack/snowflake
{{< / command >}}

You can start the Snowflake Docker container using the following methods:

1. [`localstack` CLI](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/#localstack-cli)
2. [`docker` CLI](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### `localstack` CLI

To start the Snowflake Docker container using the `localstack` CLI, execute the following command:

{{< command >}}
$ export LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=<your_auth_token>
$ IMAGE_NAME=localstack/snowflake localstack start
{{< / command >}}

### `docker` CLI

To start the Snowflake Docker container using the `docker` CLI, execute the following command:

{{< command >}}
$ docker run \
    --rm -it \
    -p 4566:4566 \
    -e LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=${LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN:?} \
    localstack/snowflake
{{< / command >}}

### Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the specified content:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  localstack:
    container_name: "localstack-main"
    image: localstack/snowflake
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:4566:4566"
    environment:
      - LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=${LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN:?}
    volumes:
      - "./volume:/var/lib/localstack"
```

Start the Snowflake Docker container with the following command:

{{< command >}}
$ docker-compose up
{{< / command >}}

### Updating

To update the Snowflake Docker container, pull the latest image and restart the container. The `latest` tag is the nightly build of the Snowflake Docker image.

## LocalStack Extension mechanism (deprecated)

The LocalStack Extension mechanism allows you to install and manage extensions for LocalStack.
Extensions are packaged as Python applications, and can be installed using:

1. [`localstack` CLI](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/#localstack-cli)
2. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Note that installing the Snowflake emulator via the LocalStack Extension mechanism is deprecated by now, and is not guaranteed to work with all versions of LocalStack.
We recommend using the custom LocalStack Snowflake Docker image, described further above in this document.

### `localstack` CLI

To install the Snowflake emulator using the `localstack` CLI, execute the following command:

{{< command >}}
$ localstack extensions install localstack-extension-snowflake
{{< / command >}}

Upon successful installation, you should see the output listing the installed extension.

```bash 
[20:30:06] Extension successfully installed                                                 extensions.py:86

```

### Docker Compose

To install the Snowflake emulator using Docker Compose, use the `EXTENSION_AUTO_INSTALL` environment variable for automatic extension installation. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the specified content:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  localstack:
    container_name: "localstack-main"
    image: localstack/localstack-pro
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:4566:4566"
      - "127.0.0.1:4510-4559:4510-4559"
    environment:
      - LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=${LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN:?}
      - DEBUG=1
      - EXTENSION_AUTO_INSTALL=localstack-extension-snowflake
    volumes:
      - "./volume:/var/lib/localstack"
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
```

Start the Snowflake emulator with the following command:

{{< command >}}
$ docker-compose up
{{< / command >}}

### Updating

To update the Snowflake emulator using the `localstack` CLI, uninstall and install the extension again:

{{< command >}}
$ localstack extensions uninstall localstack-extension-snowflake
$ localstack extensions install localstack-extension-snowflake
{{< / command >}}

For Docker Compose, update the extension by restarting the LocalStack container.

## Troubleshooting

### How to check if the Snowflake emulator is running?

You can check if the Snowflake emulator is running by executing the following command:

{{< command >}}
$ curl -d '{}' snowflake.localhost.localstack.cloud:4566/session
{"success": true}
{{< / command >}}

### How to enable detailed debug logs?

You can set the `SF_LOG=trace` environment variable in the Snowflake container to enable detailed trace logs that show all the request/response message.

When using `docker-compose` then simply add this variable to the `environment` section of the YAML configuration file.
If you're starting up via the `localstack start` CLI, then make sure to start up via the following configuration: 

{{< command >}}
$ DOCKER_FLAGS='-e SF_LOG=trace' DEBUG=1 IMAGE_NAME=localstack/snowflake localstack start
{{< / command >}}

### The `snowflake.localhost.localstack.cloud` hostname doesn't resolve on my machine, what can I do?

On some systems, including some newer versions of MacOS, the domain name `snowflake.localhost.localstack.cloud` may not resolve properly.
If you are encountering network issues and your Snowflake client drivers are unable to connect to the emulator, you may need to manually add the following entry to your `/etc/hosts` file:

{{< command >}}
127.0.0.1	snowflake.localhost.localstack.cloud
{{< / command >}}

## Next steps

Now that the Snowflake emulator is installed, you can use it for developing and testing your Snowflake data pipelines. Refer to our [Quickstart]({{< ref "quickstart" >}}) guide to get started.
