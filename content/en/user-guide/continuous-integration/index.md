description: Get started with Snowflake emulator in continuous integration (CI) environments
---

## Introduction

This guide explains how to set up the LocalStack Snowflake emulator in a continuous integration (CI) environment. You can use the emulator to test your Snowflake integration without connecting to the real Snowflake instance.

To install the LocalStack Snowflake emulator, you need to set up the LocalStack CLI and download the extension. The emulator provides an endpoint to connect to the emulated Snowflake instance, which you can use to test your Snowflake integration in CI environments.

## Configure the LocalStack CI Key

Before you begin, set up the LocalStack CI key to activate the Snowflake emulator in your CI environment. LocalStack requires a CI Key for use in continuous integration (CI) or similar machine environments. Each instance startup in a CI or comparable environment consumes one CI token.

To create a CI key, follow these steps:

1. Open the [LocalStack Web Application](https://app.localstack.cloud).
2. Click the [**CI Keys**](https://app.localstack.cloud/workspace/ci-keys) on the left navigation pane.
3. Navigate to the **Generate CI Key** tab, enter a description, and click **Generate CI Key**.
4. Copy the generated CI key and set it as the `LOCALSTACK_API_KEY` environment variable in your CI environment.

## Setup the CI configuration

To set up the LocalStack Snowflake emulator in your CI environment, you need to install the LocalStack CLI and download the Snowflake emulator extension. The following examples demonstrates how to set up the emulator in GitHub Actions, CircleCI, and GitLab CI.
